# Results Publishing and Student Dashboard Integration

This document explains how the admin published results are now integrated with the student dashboard.

## How It Works

### 1. Admin Publishes Results

When an admin uploads and publishes exam results through the `PublishResults` page:

1. **File Upload**: Admin uploads Excel/CSV file with student results
2. **Data Processing**: The system automatically processes and formats the data
3. **Firebase Storage**: Results are saved to the `examResults` collection in Firestore
4. **Real-time Updates**: Published results are immediately available to students

### 2. Student Views Results

When students search for their results in the `StudentDashboard`:

1. **Search by Roll Number**: Students enter their roll number
2. **Data Retrieval**: System fetches all exam results for that student from Firebase
3. **Analytics Calculation**: Real-time calculation of rankings, improvements, and statistics
4. **Dynamic Display**: Shows comprehensive results with class rankings and subject-wise performance

      studentName: "John Doe",
      totalMarks: 270,
      percentage: 90.0,
      rank: 1,
      physics: 90,
      chemistry: 85,
      mathematics: 95
    }
    // ... more student results
  ]
}
```
