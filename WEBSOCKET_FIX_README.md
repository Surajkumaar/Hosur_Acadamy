# WebSocket Connection Error Fix & Admin Logout Feature

## Problem Fixed: WebSocket Connection Errors
The React development server was showing WebSocket connection errors:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:443/ws' failed: Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by incorrect WebSocket development server (WDS) configuration in the `.env` file:
- `WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443` was forcing the WebSocket to connect to port 443
- React development server typically runs on port 3000, not 443

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Configuration
- **File**: `frontend/.env`
- **Change**: Commented out `WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443` 
- **Added**: 
  ```
  WDS_SOCKET_HOST=localhost
  FAST_REFRESH=true
  WDS_SOCKET_PATH=/ws
  ```

### 2. Fixed Admin Component Re-rendering
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`
- **Issue**: The useEffect was running multiple times causing repeated console logs
- **Solution**: Added `useRef` to track if the effect has already run

### 3. Added Admin Logout Feature
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`
- **New Features**:
  - **Logout Button**: Added a logout button in the admin dashboard header
  - **User Information Display**: Shows current admin email and role
  - **Toast Notifications**: Provides user feedback for logout success/failure
  - **Loading State**: Shows "Logging out..." text during logout process
  - **Proper Navigation**: Redirects to login page after successful logout

#### Logout Feature Details:
- **Location**: Admin dashboard header (top-right corner)
- **Visual Design**: Red-styled button with LogOut icon
- **Functionality**:
  - Calls Firebase Auth logout
  - Shows toast notification on success/failure
  - Redirects to login page after successful logout
  - Handles errors gracefully with user feedback
  - Prevents multiple logout attempts with loading state

### 4. Updated Template File
- **File**: `frontend/.env.template`
- **Change**: Updated template to include proper WebSocket configuration for future deployments

## How This Fixes the Issues

1. **WebSocket Errors**: By removing the port override and setting proper host/path, the WebSocket will use the default React dev server port
2. **Admin Re-rendering**: The `useRef` prevents the useEffect from running multiple times
3. **User Experience**: Added logout functionality with proper feedback and navigation
4. **Development Experience**: Hot reloading should now work properly without connection errors

## Verification
After applying these fixes:
1. ✅ WebSocket connection errors should disappear
2. ✅ Admin component should only log access checks once
3. ✅ Hot reloading should work normally
4. ✅ Admin can logout properly with visual feedback
5. ✅ No impact on production builds

## Additional Notes
- These changes only affect the development environment
- Production builds are not affected by WebSocket configuration
- If you still see issues, you can disable hot reloading entirely by setting `DISABLE_HOT_RELOAD=true` in `.env`
- The logout feature uses the existing Firebase Auth logout functionality
- Toast notifications provide better UX compared to browser alerts
