# Student Login with Date of Birth Feature

## Overview
This feature allows admin to create students with email and date of birth, and then students can login using their email and date of birth as password.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`server.py`)

1. **Updated Student Model**:
   - Added `date_of_birth: str` field to the Student model

2. **Enhanced Login Endpoint**:
   - Modified `/api/login` to support student authentication
   - Students can now login with email + date of birth (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Admin login remains unchanged (admin@example.com / admin)

3. **Updated User Management**:
   - Modified `/api/user` endpoint to handle student tokens
   - Student tokens format: `student_{id}_{email}`

4. **Enhanced Student CRUD Operations**:
   - `/api/students` (POST): Creates student in both 'students' and 'users' collections
   - `/api/students/{id}` (PUT): Updates student in both collections
   - `/api/students/{id}` (DELETE): Deletes student from both collections
   - `/api/students` (GET): Includes date_of_birth in response

5. **Added Test Endpoint**:
   - `/api/test-student-login`: Test endpoint to verify student credentials

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated StudentFormModal**:
   - Added `date_of_birth` field with date input
   - Added helpful text explaining this will be the student's password

2. **Updated ManageStudents**:
   - Added Date of Birth column to the students table
   - Updated CSV export to include date of birth
   - Fixed field name mapping between frontend (`rollNo`) and backend (`roll_no`)
   - Added defensive programming for `searchTerm` undefined error

3. **Updated Login Page**:
   - Added helpful messages for students and admin
   - Clarified that students should use date of birth as password

4. **Added Test Page**:
   - Created `TestStudentLogin.jsx` for testing the feature
   - Allows testing student credentials before actual login

## How to Use

### For Admin:
1. Login with admin credentials (admin@example.com / admin)
2. Go to Admin â†’ Manage Students
3. Click "Add Student"
4. Fill in all details including Date of Birth
5. Save the student

### For Students:
1. Go to the Login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Enter your date of birth as password (YYYY-MM-DD format)
4. Login successfully

## Testing the Feature

1. **Create a Test Student**:
   - Email: test@student.com
   - Date of Birth: 2000-01-01
   - Fill other required fields

2. **Test Login**:
   - Use TestStudentLogin page (if added to routing)
   - Or directly try logging in with test@student.com / 2000-01-01

## Database Structure

Students are stored in two Firestore collections:

1. **students collection**: Primary student data
2. **users collection**: For authentication compatibility

Both collections contain the same data with proper field mapping.

## Security Notes

- Date of birth is used as a temporary password
- In production, consider implementing password reset functionality
- Student tokens include ID and email for proper identification
- All CRUD operations maintain data consistency across collections

## Error Handling

- Login endpoint validates email and date format
- Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- Defensive programming for undefined variables
- Graceful handling of missing data fields
